API Overview
============

Document the public interfaces (REST, WebSocket, CLI hooks) used by the Electron UI.
Each endpoint/channel should link back to source modules plus sample payloads.

Include sections for:

- Authentication between Electron preload scripts and Django
- Dataset queue endpoints
- Task runner endpoints that surface `django-tasks` progress
