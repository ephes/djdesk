Documentation Changelog
=======================

Unreleased
----------

Added
~~~~~

- Introduced the Inspector workspace explorer with workspaces, scan jobs, task presets, curated
  doc links, services, and tests so the desktop shell can analyze and orchestrate local Django
  projects from the Electron UI.
- Built an interactive Inspector dashboard experience with schema visualization assets,
  templatetags, and wizard/dashboard templates that surface curated insights directly in the app.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The bundled Electron launcher now applies Django migrations automatically during packaging so
  the embedded SQLite schema stays current when distributing desktop builds.
- Linux Electron builds are temporarily disabled in CI while the packaging pipeline is stabilized,
  preventing broken artifacts from being published.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Expanded the tutorial and reference material with the full Inspector flow (tutorial chapters,
  concepts, architecture, and API/WebSocket docs) so the documentation matches the product surface.
- Rewrote the Electron packaging guide and ensured the Read the Docs requirements install
  ``django-tasks`` so published instructions stay accurate with the codebase.

0.1.0 (2025-11-15)
------------------

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

- Bootstrapped the Django + Electron project structure with uv-powered installation, ``just``
  recipes for dev/lint/test, and manage.py-based test execution to streamline contributor
  onboarding.
- Added the initial packaging toolchain: bundled the Django payload and python-build-standalone
  interpreter, enforced explicit settings modules, and introduced cross-platform build recipes plus
  verification workflows.
- Delivered GitHub Actions and ``just`` helpers for downloading per-OS artifacts, cleaning build
  outputs, and triggering manual desktop workflow runs, making it easier to share distributable
  installers.
- Set up the Sphinx documentation scaffold, README improvements (including RTD links), and
  contributor guidance (CLAUDE/agent instructions) to support future documentation releases.
