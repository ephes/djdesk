Core Concepts
=============

High-level guidance for the DJDesk Control Room experience. Use this chapter to explain
why Electron wraps Django, what "workspaces" represent, and how datasets flow from
imports through automation to insights.

Reference material to add:

- Local-first design principles drawn from ``specs/2025-11-16_app_contents.md``
- Responsibilities split between Django (data + APIs) and Electron (OS integrations)
- Feature flag nomenclature and how tutorial stages map to them
